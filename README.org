#+TITLE: ST terminal customization

This is my [[https://st.suckless.org/][st]] configuration with /no manual editing required for builds on BSD platforms/.

* Customization

- Font size increased and terminal name set to =xterm-256color=
- [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/][xresources]] patch
- Additional =mk= files to allow building transparently on both Linux and BSD (NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD).

* Requirements

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt-get install build-essential \
       libfontconfig1-dev \
       libfreetype-dev \
       x11proto-dev \
       libx11-dev \
       libxft-dev
#+end_src

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make && sudo cp st /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC
