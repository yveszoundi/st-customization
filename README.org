#+TITLE: ST terminal customizations

This is my [[https://st.suckless.org/][st]] configuration.

* Customization

- Font size increased
- Additional =mk= files to allow building transparently on both Linux and BSD (OpenBSD and FreeBSD).

* Requirements

  sudo apt-get install build-essential \
       libfontconfig1-dev \
       libfreetype-dev \
       x11proto-dev \
       libx11-dev \
       libxft-dev
#+end_src

* Installation

  make && sudo cp st /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC
